> The problem was mainly because of the VSCode's environment variable ... I unset the GTK_PATH environment variable for VSCode using ... uset GTK_PATH

> This did not solved the problem in my case. My solution was to uninstall VSCode (which was previously installed from the Ubuntu Store - snap) and download the .deb directly and install it with apt.

```
$ echo $GTK_PATH
// /snap/code/167/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gtk-3.0
```
Obviously snap/code is hogging on GTK_PATH, but how would I know it's that veriable thats causing probems??
The message clearly shows that 'code' is hijacking the veriable that qemu needs. So let's try to reinstall VSCode without snap...
